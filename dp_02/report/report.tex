\section{Summary Information}
The secret message is ``HMC''. The maximum range that we predicted our receiver would work at was 250 m.
The maximum range we were able to test was 72.3 m due to running out of cable length in the hallway.
The analytical system temperature was 8.22E+10 K and the measured temperature was 7.13E+07 K.
The analytical receiver IIP3 was -26.77 dBm and the measured one was -62.5 dBm.

	\end{centering}
\end{figure}

The oscilloscope trace can be decoded by treating it as a 10 kbps signal where the high and low levels indicated above represents 1s and 0s respectively (the exact high level voltage depends on distance). The component representing the 0 frequency is attenuated by the mixer, so it is not visible and only the component representing the 1 frequency is left. The data is transmitted at 10 kbps so the duration of each bit is 0.1 ms.

\noindent
Each message starts with a \texttt{01010101} frame which can be ignored, followed by 24 bits encoded as described above. The 24 bits should be split up into groups of 8 and decoded as ASCII characters, resulting in the message ``HMC''.

\section{Antenna Information}

\end{figure}

As this is not an antenna we measured in lab 5, we extracted the radiation pattern and S11. The radiation pattern was measured in the RF lab anechoic chamber with the Keysight 8753D VNA on a turn table as pictured above. S21 was measured at incremental angles and the antenna gain was calculated using the following equation:
$$
G_{TX}=S21-G_{cal}-20\log\left(\frac{\lambda}{4\pi r}\right)
$$
Producing the following plot:

	\begin{centering}
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{figures/antenna.radiation}
		\caption{H-A16SD radiation pattern}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
\noindent
The directivity of this antenna is 3.49 dB. At 0 deg we also measured S11 and other S parameters:

	\begin{centering}
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{figures/antenna.sparams}
		\caption{H-A16SD S parameters}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
\noindent
At the frequency we are working at (around 2276 MHz) we measured an S11 of 0.39 dB which should be impossible for a passive component like an antenna. We hypothesize that this is due to our reference plane being too far away from the antenna and that the homemade RP-SMA to SMA adapter could be causing issues, but did not have time to test this.

The two peaks at 2.258 and 2.298 GHz are the two tones of our signal. The peaks between 2.4 and 2.5 GHz are from WiFi, the small bump around 2.15 GHz is likely a cellular band using OFDM modulation.

There are no peaks in the RF spectra because the low input power to the mixer was not enough to cause leakage above the noise floor.

\section{Theoretical Signal and Noise Levels} \label{sec:sig_and_noise}
The link and noise budget excel spreadsheet with all calculations is here \url{github.com/kavidey/e157/raw/refs/heads/main/dp_02/receiver/link_budget.xlsx}
\subsection{Signal Level Theory}
Signal levels were calculated at each component in the receiver chain using their corresponding equations. Passive components including mixers, filters, and attenuators reduce signal strength via insertion loss. Amplifiers increase signal strength via gain, and generate distortion and intermodulation harmonics. For this report, we only focused on the IM3 harmonics those are in the baseband and we are not doing direct downconversion. IM3 harmonic size was calculated from OIP3 and IIP3 using the following formula:
$$
IM3 = OIP3 - 3 \cdot (IIP3 - Pin)
$$
OIP3 was read off of amplifier datasheets directly (\href{https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/1030/ZX60-2531MA_2b-1701661.pdf}{ZX60-2531MA+} and \href{https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/1030/ZFL_1000LN_2b-2303490.pdf}{ZFL-1000LN}). IIP3 was calculated from datasheet ``Output power at P-1dB'' as $IIP3 = P_{-1dB,out} - (G_{ain} - 1) + 9.6$. Propagating power through each step of the receiver chain. A full list of important component properties in section \ref{sec:additional}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{centering}
		\includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{figures/signal_theory}
		\caption{Theoretical and measured signal power levels}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
\noindent
These calculations were repeated for 3 m and max range test which are available in the spreadsheet linked above. In all cases the predicted noise power is quite a bit higher than the measured one. In the example above, the predicted baseband power is much larger than the expected, resulting in massively larger IM3 components.
\subsection{Noise Level Theory}
Noise levels were calculated in a few steps. First, the noise temperature of each component was calculated from theory: $T_p = \left(\frac{1}{L}-1\right)T$ for passives and $T_a = (nf-1)T$ for amplifiers. Next, the system temperature at each point in the receive chain was calculated as $T_{out} = \{G \text{ or } L \} \cdot(T_{in} + T_d)$ where $T_d$ is the component temperature. Notably the system temperature was multiplied by two for mixers as the produce two copies of the noise. This temperature was also converted to dBm for easier comparison to measured noise level. Note that the assumed antenna noise as 290K from pointing at earth.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{centering}
		\includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{figures/noise_theory}
		\caption{Theoretical and measured signal noise levels}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
\noindent
Similar to the signal power, the analytical noise temperature much larger (three orders of magnitude higher) than the measured noise temperature. Both of these is likely due to over estimating the gain of the amplifiers.
\\
\\
\noindent
The theoretical maximum range was calculated by testing different distances in the spreadsheet until the signal power was equal to the noise power.

\newpage
\section{IP3 Distortion Characterization}
To measure the IIP3 of our amplifier we replaced the antenna with a two tone signal generator. We tested a range of input powers and measured the output power of the fundamental and the IM3 terms to make the following plot.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{centering}
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{figures/iip3_regression.pdf}
		\caption{Analytical and measured IIP3}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
Running a linear regression we get:
\\
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{lrr}
		\toprule
		Term & Slope & Intercept \\
		\midrule
		Linear & 1.21 & 30.12 \\
		3rd Order & 2.9 & 75.34 \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent
To calculate the analytical IP3 point we used the following logic. We only need to consider the IM3 components generated by the last amplifier because they are orders of magnitude larger than the earlier ones. This allows us to simplify the receiver chain into gain $\to$ amplifier $\to$ attenuation.
\\
\\
\noindent
Adding additional (assumed perfectly linear) gain $G$ before the final amplifier reduces the input power needed to achieve the same output power. In other words reduces $IIP3$ to $IIP3_{combined} = IIP3_{amplifier} - G$ while keeping the same $OIP3$. Adding additional attenuation $L$ after the final amplifier reduces the total output, keeping $IIP3$ the same and reducing $OIP3$ to $OIP3_{combined} = OIP3_{amplifier} - L$.
\\
\\
\noindent
Our final amplifier (stage 7) is the ZFL-1000LN which has an $IIP3$ of -6.4 dBm and $OIP3$ of 14 dBm (from the \href{https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/1030/ZFL_1000LN_2b-2303490.pdf}{device datasheet}). Adding up all the amplification and attenuation from stages 1-6, we get $G$ = 56.1 dBm and addding up the attenuation from stages 8-9 we get $L$ = -7 dBm. This results in analytical $IIP3$ = -62.5 and $OIP3$ = 7 dBm.
\\
\\
\noindent
To verify this calculation, we tested different power values in the signal and noise level excel spreadsheet we made for section \ref{sec:sig_and_noise} until the IM3 components were equal to the signal power. This yielded an $IIP3$ = -61 dBm and $OIP3$ = 10 dBm, fairly close to the other analytical method.
\\
\\
\noindent
Note that both analytical methods are fairly far away from the measured value. This is likely due to a combination of noisy measurements (neither line in the measured plot has the correct slope) and incorrect gain/IIP3/OIP3 values as discussed in section \ref{sec:sig_and_noise}. The data here implies that IIP3 and gain before stage 7 are less accurate the OIP3 and the attenuation after stage 7.
